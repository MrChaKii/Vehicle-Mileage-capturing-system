# Backend configuration

## Local environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in this directory and fill in the values for your
machine. `.env` files are ignored by Git; commit only the blank `.env.example`
template. The backend reads `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` for signing tokens. Keep all
backend secrets on the server and configure production values using your hosting
provider's environment-variable settings.

## Google Drive meter photos

Meter photos are uploaded to a private Google Drive folder. The database stores
the Drive file ID; image requests are served by the backend only to admin and
superadmin accounts.

1. Enable the Google Drive API in the Google Cloud project associated with the
   existing OAuth client.
2. Obtain a refresh token for the Google account that owns or has edit access
   to the private Drive folder. The OAuth grant must include the
   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` scope.
3. Configure `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`,
   `GOOGLE_DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN`, and `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` in the backend
   environment. See `.env.example`. `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` is optional and is
   only needed if it was part of the OAuth refresh-token flow.

Keep the Drive folder private. The backend returns a clear upload error if the
OAuth credentials are missing or the account cannot access the folder. Keep
OAuth secrets in the backend environment only; do not expose them to the
frontend or commit them to source control.

## Monthly mileage reminder emails

All users who own personal and company vehicles have to submit a mileage reading within the first two days of a month. If no reading has been submitted, the user gets a reminder email via Nodemailer. For this to work, SMTP needs to be configured.

Configure SMTP in the backend environment (`backend/.env`):

| Variable      | What it holds                                                                     | Example                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SMTP_HOST`   | The address of the mail server that sends the email.                              | `smtp.gmail.com` (if you're using Gmail or Google Workspace)                            |
| `MAIL_FROM`   | The sender shown on the email                                                     | `janedoe@gmail.com`                                                                     |
| `APP_URL`     | The link to be put in the email.                                                  | `http://localhost:5173/`                                                                |
| `SMTP_USER`   | The account you log in with (often the full email address of the sending account) | `janedoe@gmail.com` (for Gmail, `MAIL_FROM` should use the same address as `SMTP_USER`) |
| `SMTP_PASS`   | That account's password (for Gmail, an app password)                              | `vowbwoojinxjozes`                                                                      |
| `SMTP_PORT`   | The port number on the mail server                                                | `587` (the default)                                                                     |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | Decides whether the connection is encrypted from the start, or uses STARTTLS      | `true` only on port 465, otherwise `false`                                              |
